Next generation sequencing simulator, sequence enrichment simulator and
related computational tools to perform bioinformatics analysis of
sequences of interest, based on comparative genomics / HMM / sequence
homology / phylogenetics information.

Various pure python modules represent different procedures of the approaches.

A run python script conducts the experiments.

A control parameters file holds the neccessary parameters to perform the
various experiments.
