Next generation sequencing simulator, sequence enrichment simulator and
related computational tools to perform bioinformatics analysis of
sequences of interest, based on comparative genomics / HMM / sequence
homology / phylogenetics information.

Various pure python modules represent different procedures of the approaches.

A drive python script conducts the various types of experiments.

A control parameters file holds the neccessary parameters to perform each
differrent part of the experiments.
